 
## ImPlot for Go
This library is a [Go](https://www.golang.org) wrapper for [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot/), for use with [imgui-go](https://github.com/inkyblackness/imgui-go) which wraps [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

It currently targets `ImPlot v0.13` with `imgui-go v4.4.0` (which wraps `Dear ImGui v1.85`).

It has similar goals compared to inkyblackness's imgui-go wrapper:
 - [x] hand-crafted
 - [x] documented
 - [ ] feature-complete
 - [ ] versioned
 - [x] with examples (living in another repo [here](https://github.com/Edgaru089/implot-go-example))
