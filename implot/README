This folder houses a ImPlot release (from the release tab, not the repo
directly), as well as a ImGUI release that must be in sync with
inkyblackness/imgui-go. This is because the Go linker is not for C/C++
and links each package indepedently, which is bad.

If you don't do that, the linker might get angry about ABI compatibility,
and, even if you were able to link, the IMGUI_CHECKVERSION() marco would
do its job, which is to crash the program if the versions and data
layouts does not match.

go.mod specifies a strict version of imgui-go required, so that should
not be a problem. It should also be quite easy to hack up this folder
(and go.mod) yourself to link with another imgui-go/ImPlot version.


------


The Makefile is used to speed up compiles of the ImGUI/ImPlot dependencies
in development, and is enabled by build tag "prebuilt". If you have things
like MSYS2, this should be easy to hack for Windows.
